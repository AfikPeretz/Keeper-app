# Keeper-App

This project is all about React and is designed to practice the idea of decomposing into components and using hooks.
In the project I built a web app that serves as an interactive message board, so that at any given stage you can add or remove a note from the board.
Feel free to contact me with any questions, enjoy!

**In the last commit it is of course a spelling error and should be "Adding yarn"
